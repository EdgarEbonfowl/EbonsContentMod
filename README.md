# Ebon's Content Mod
This mod was created to add new content into Wrath of the Righteous that wasn't represented in the other major content mods. This requires [TabletopTweaks-Core](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Core "TabletopTweaks-Core") and is partially dependent upon [TabletopTweaks-Base](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Base "TabletopTweaks-Base"), though it will work without it.

## Added Races
This mod adds the following races to the game and they should work like the default races. Note, I have not completed a playthrough with these races, so you may experience some strange behavior, especially in dialog, where the race type either is not recognized or, more likely, is recognized as some other race (an NPC calling your drow character an elf, for instnace). That being said, if you encounter bugs, please report them!

If you don't see your favorite race here: the way I do races involves cloning, recoloring, and then cobling together base game assets (think Mr. Potatohead plus a paint brush), so only races that can be made from vanilla assets are included here. That means no tengu, no catfolk, etc. If you want me to make a race that would look acceptable with vanilla assets let me know OR if you have some 3D modeling skills and want to submit custom assets, I can make your race. Currently, only the goblin is using anything custom. Playable Mongrels and Ganzi will be coming in a future update.

## Ability Fixes
- Come And Get Me! barbarian power now works correctly with the skald's raging song. The vanilla version only affected the skald, not teammates. It will be disabled any time a teammate steps out of the song's aura then steps back in, so be aware of that.
- Discordant Voice feat now applies to any ally within the area of effect of any bard song rather than just the beneficial ones.

## Mechanics Fixes/Changes
- Multi-projectile spells (Hellfire Ray, Scorching Ray, etc.) that should be able to assign projectiles to different targets per tabletop rules will now switch to a new target if the current target dies, rather than just dumping all the extra projectiles into the first target's corpse. All tabletop targeting rules are respected - for instance, no two targets can be more than 30 feet apart for Hellfire Ray. There was some early inconsistency here, but I think I have corrected any flaws in the implementation and my current testing seems to indicate that this consistently works as intended - please submit an issue report if you find otherwise.
