# Modder Notes
I generally tried to follow exact implementations of tabletop rules. Where I diverged from those rules, I will do my best to explain my decision making here. Unfortunately, the possibilities within Wrath/Unity, while broad, are not equivalent to the possibilities of the imagination, nor is my skill as a modder!
